        <p> 
            My name is Katelyn, I'm a programmer who specializes in C#, C++, 
            and some Python. I began my programming journey
            with the creation of visual novels and
            have a passion for storytelling and Game Development. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My biggest inspirations for developing games are RPGMaker
            horror games as they were games that kickstarted my love
            for interesting stories. Witch's House and Mad Father
            are two of my favorites.
