                    My name is Katelyn, I'm a programmer who specializes in C#, C++, 
                    and some Python. I began my programming journey
                    with the creation of visual novels and
                    have a passion for storytelling and Game Development.

                    My biggest inspirations for developing games are RPGMaker
                    horror games as they were games that kickstarted my love
                    for interesting stories. Witch's House and Mad Father
                    are two of my favorites.
