                    My name is Katelyn, I'm a 21 year old woman who lives in the south. I'm
                    a graduate of Academy Of Interactive Entertainment (AIE) and have an
                    Associate of Occupational Studies in Game Programming. Oddly enough though,
                    my journey into game development did not with me wanting to tell games,
                    but rather, tell stories.

                    When I was in highschool I had originally intended to 
                    become an illustrator. However, I found as I carried on into senior year
                    that just showing people my illustrations wasn't enough, I wanted people
                    to know and understand the stories behind the things I created, I just
                    wasn't entirely sure how to do so.

                    That was until I discovered Ren'py, a visual novel engine.
                    making a visual novel was something I entertained for a while
                    so as a teenager with nothing much to do I decided to give it
                    a shot. Next thing I know, I created and finished my first visual
                    novel, Project 4th Wall, and it recieved some engagement. I began
                    to post smaller games under the alias "JellioGushi" for that small 
                    period of time.

                    As I learned I started to entertain the idea of game development
                    more and more, and now here I am! Feel free to take a look at my
                    projects page to see what I have accomplished since then. I now no longer
                    use the alias of JellioGushi for my professional work.
