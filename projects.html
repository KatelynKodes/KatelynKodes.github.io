                                    Project 4th Wall was my first game. It was a visual novel where the player
                                    is invited onto a test project to bring two androids to life. The game had branching
                                    route options and some minigames the player could play to progress the story.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My responsibilities on this project were mostly everything,
                                    I created all the art and programmed the game from scratch using the visual novel engine Renpy.
                                    The only thing I did not create was the music. I sourced the music from
                                    Eric Matyas' library of copyright free music,
