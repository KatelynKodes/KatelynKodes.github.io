                            So my first order of buisness was getting player and camera movement down, I made a
                            C# script that would hold all of the player information and functions. After setting up the input buttons
                            using Godot's Input Map feature in project settings, I made a Vector 2 that takes the input axis of
                            the current input and multiplied that vector by the players speed. I also integrated a run mechanic
                            where the player's speed would change if the player presses SHIFT.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once I got player movement down, I then turned my attention to camera movement. As opposed to
                            childing the camera to the player, I created a C# script that obtained the players position
                            then moved the camera to that position every update. The reason I chose to do this instead
                            is so the camera can maintain it's own Local and Global position.

                            Initially at the start of this project I told myself to hold off on art assets.
                            This was so that I could pace myself and focus on the priority of finishing script aspects,
                            however I wanted to make my project a teeny bit more presentable in these devlogs, so I made
                            this little sprite of a Knight character. This may not be the final product. I also made
                            a little crossbow for the feature I'm planning for next devlog.

                        <p>
                            I then imported the sprites into the godot engine and darkened the scene color to be black.
                            With that, I finished player and camera movement.

                        <p>That is all I did for this devlog, my next goal is working on the crossbow.</p>
