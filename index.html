                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Katelyn West and I'm a programmer who resides in Louisiana. I'm a innovative individual who's always looking to learn new things and aspires to refine things to as best as they can be!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I originally started my programming journey with the intent of developing video games. I began by programming in Python on the Renp'y engine to make visual novels Though recently my eyes have been drifting elsewhere, I'm an ever-hungry creature, and the more I learn the more I crave. A horrible ouroboros I have been condemmed with since birth. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I don't believe my game development years left me completely fruitless though, I heavily enjoy UI development which is applicable across every application known to man. I believe applications should be not only understandable to their users, but accessible wherever possible.

                            Frigid Peak is a game where you play as a hiker trying to reach the top of a snowy mountain. The goal of the game is to reach the topmost platform while avoiding snowballs being thrown by a yeti at the top of the mountain. It was a project for my first semester at AIE
