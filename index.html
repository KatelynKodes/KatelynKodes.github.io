                <p>My name is Katelyn, I'm a computer programmer with five years of experience who is 
                    fluent in C++ and C#, I work primarily in Unreal and Unity Engine. 
                    I'm also familar with some aspects of Python, HTML, and Javascript.
                    This is my portfolio website, here you will find information about
                    me as well as some of the projects I've worked on. I'm primarily skilled when it comes to UI functionality, debugging, and smaller
                    game mechanics. However I'm open to learning more skills.</p>
    
                <p>When it comes to developing games my main focus is making sure a game not
                    only is delivered on time but making sure the quality of the game does not
                    suffer because of time constraints. I <b>heavily</b> value quality in my games
                    and make sure they are as best as they can be before they reach publishing stage.
